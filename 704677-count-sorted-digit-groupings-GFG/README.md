# [Count Sorted Digit Groupings](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/count-digit-groupings-of-a-number1520/1)
## Medium
Given a string s consisting of digits, you can split it into contiguous substrings (sub-groups).&nbsp;For example, the string "112" can be split as: ["1","1","2"], ["11","2"], ["1","12"], and ["112"].
A grouping is considered valid if the sums of digits of the sub-groups form a non-decreasing sequence from left to right.
Determine the total number of such valid groupings for the given string.
Examples:&nbsp;
Input: s = "1119"
Output: 7
Explanation: One valid grouping is ["1", "11", "9"].
The sum of digits of the first sub-group ("1") is 1,
for the second sub-group ("11"), it is 2,
and for the third sub-group ("9"), it is 9.
Since the sums are in non-decreasing order (1 ≤ 2 ≤ 9), this is a valid grouping.
The other valid groupings are:
["1", "119"], ["1", "1", "19"], ["1", "1", "1", "9"], ["11", "19"], ["111", "9"], and ["1119"].
Thus, the total number of valid groupings is 7.
Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: ["1","2"] and ["12"] are two valid groupings.

Constraints:1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 100s[i]&nbsp;∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

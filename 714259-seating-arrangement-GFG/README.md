# [Seating Arrangement](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/seating-arrangement--170647/1)
## Easy
Given an integer k representing the number of people to be seated and an array seats[], where 0 denotes an empty seat and 1 denotes an occupied seat.
 Determine whether it is possible to seat all k people such that no two occupied seats are adjacent&nbsp;(including newly seated people).
Note:&nbsp;Existing occupied seats may already be adjacent.
Examples:
Input: k = 2, seats[] = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
Output: true
Explanation: The two people can sit at index 0 and 4.

Input: k = 1, seats[] = [0, 1, 0]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to get a seat for one person.

Input: k = 0, seats[] = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
Output: false
Explanation: The seating arrangement already contains two adjacent occupied seats at indices 3 and 4.
Constraints:0 ≤ k ≤ 105 1 ≤ seats.size() ≤ 105seats[i] == 0 or seats[i] == 1

# [Replace with XOR of Adjacent](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/replace-with-xor-of-adjacent/1)
## Easy
Given an array arr[] of n integers,&nbsp;modify the array in-place such that each element is replaced with the XOR of its adjacent elements.

For the first element, update arr[0] = arr[0] ^ arr[1].
For the last element, update arr[n-1] = arr[n-2] ^ arr[n-1].
For all other elements, update arr[i] = arr[i-1] ^ arr[i+1].

Note:&nbsp;Here, a ^ b represents the XOR operation between a and b.&nbsp;
Examples :
Input : arr[] = [2, 1, 4, 7]
Output : [3, 6, 6, 3]
Explanation:
At index 0, arr[0] ^ arr[1] = 2 ^ 1 = 3
At index 1, arr[0] ^ arr[2] = 2 ^ 4 = 6
At index 2, arr[1] ^ arr[3] = 1 ^ 7 = 6At index 3, arr[2] ^ arr[3] = 4 ^ 7 = 3
Thus, the updated array becomes [3, 6, 6, 3].

Input : arr[] = [5, 9, 2, 6, 7]
Output: [12, 7, 15, 5, 1]
Explanation:At index 0, arr[0] ^ arr[1] = 5 ^ 9 = 12
At index 1, arr[0] ^ arr[2] = 5 ^ 2 = 7
At index 2, arr[1] ^ arr[3] = 9 ^ 6 = 15
At index 3, arr[2] ^ arr[4] = 2 ^ 7 = 5
At index 4, arr[3] ^ arr[4] = 6 ^ 7 = 1
Thus, the updated array becomes [12, 7, 15, 5, 1]. 
Constraints:2 ≤ n ≤ 1051 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 107

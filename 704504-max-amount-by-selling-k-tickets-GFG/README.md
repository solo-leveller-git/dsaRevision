# [Max Amount by Selling K Tickets](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/ticket-sellers3241/1)
## Medium
Given an integer array arr[], where arr[i] denotes the number of tickets available with the i-th ticket seller. 

The price of each ticket is equal to the number of tickets remaining with that seller at the time of sale.&nbsp;
A seller can sell at most one ticket at a time, and after each sale, the price of the next ticket from that seller decreases by 1. 
All sellers are allowed to sell at most k tickets in total. 

Find the maximum amount that can be earned by selling k tickets. Return the answer modulo 109+7.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [4, 3, 6, 2, 4], k = 3
Output: 15
Explanation: One optimal sequence is to sell two tickets from the seller with 6 tickets (the price of first would be 6 and second 5) and one ticket from a seller with 4 tickets. This gives a total earning of 6 + 5 + 4 = 15.
Input: arr[] = [5, 3, 5, 2, 4, 4], k = 2
Output: 10
Explanation: One optimal sequence is to sell one ticket each from the two sellers with 5 tickets, earning 5 + 5 = 10.
Constraints:1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 1051 ≤ arr[i], k ≤ 106
